# Nova Retail Solutions Sales & Profit Dashboard

## Overview

This project delivers an interactive data dashboard for Nova Retail Solutions, designed to provide actionable insights into sales and profit performance across regions, shipping modes, and product categories. The dashboard centralizes key performance indicators (KPIs) and visual analytics, enabling data-driven decision-making for pricing, resource allocation, and customer engagement strategies.

## Problem Statement

Nova Retail Solutions faces challenges in identifying the key drivers behind its sales and profitability. The absence of a centralized dashboard has made it difficult for decision-makers to track KPIs, understand regional performance, evaluate shipping effectiveness, and pinpoint profitable product categories. This lack of visibility impedes informed decisions on resource allocation, pricing, and customer service improvements, ultimately affecting long-term growth objectives.

## Project Aim

The primary aim is to develop a comprehensive, interactive dashboard that:
- Analyzes sales trends over time
- Examines profit and sales across different regions
- Evaluates shipping mode performance
- Assesses product profitability and sales
- Presents KPIs such as total sales, total profit, total orders, and profit margins

The dashboard empowers Nova Retail Solutions to make strategic decisions and optimize business operations.

## Dataset Description

The dataset comprises key sales and operational data, including:
- **Order Information:** Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode
- **Customer Information:** Customer ID, Name, Segment, Country, City, State, Postal Code, Region
- **Product Information:** Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name
- **Financial Data:** Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit.

## Dashboard Features

### KPIs

- **Total Sales:** $2.29M
- **Total Profit:** $286K
- **Total Orders:** 9,000+
- These KPIs reflect strong business performance and growth across the analyzed years.

### Visualizations

- **Bar Chart:** Compares sales and profit by region, and profit by ship mode. Gold bars represent sales, purple bars indicate profit. Reveals that while sales are high, profits are comparatively lower, with standard class as the most profitable shipping mode.
- **Line Chart:** Tracks annual profit trends by segment, highlighting periods above or below average profit. Upward-facing triangles indicate peak periods above average, downward-facing triangles indicate below-average periods.
- **Donut Chart:** Illustrates the proportion of profit by product segment, with each segment's size reflecting its contribution to total profit.
- **Slicers:** Enable dynamic filtering of data by year and other dimensions for focused analysis and comparison.

## Analysis & Insights

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales and profit performance from 2014 to 2017. Interactive slicers allow users to drill down into specific years, regions, or product categories, facilitating targeted analysis.

**Key findings:**
- High sales volume does not always translate to high profit, highlighting the importance of margin analysis.
- Standard shipping mode is most profitable, suggesting operational efficiencies or customer preferences.
- Certain product segments contribute disproportionately to overall profit, as visualized in the donut chart.
- Profit trends fluctuate across segments and years, with clear periods of above- and below-average performance, guiding strategic focus for future growth.

## Recommendations

- **Optimize Pricing Strategy:** Review pricing for high- and low-performing products using insights from yearly trends and average performance to set competitive prices that maximize profit without sacrificing sales volume.
- **Product Bundling:** Offer bundles that combine high-margin and low-performing products to encourage larger purchases and boost sales across more product lines.
- **Cross-Selling and Upselling:** Promote complementary products in high-demand categories to increase average transaction value per customer.

These strategies aim to enhance sales performance through product optimization, targeted pricing, and improved customer engagement.
